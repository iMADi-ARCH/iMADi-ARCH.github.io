        People start these kind of portfolio with their name, where are they from and other useless information. I, on the other hand, am, starting with the things which you are certainly intrested in knowing about me :)

        Alright, so first of all, I am a programmer, actually a beginner and I hope I never become an advance one. xD. I code in mainly C++ and python, and now, I have started Web so you can add JS in the list but since it's not a REAL programming language, I am not adding it :p. I like games (Who doesn't?), but I like making em' and not playing em'. I like linux (or GNU/Linux as some would get MAD at me :p) and use it full time for my general studying and coding purposes. In fact, I am writing this on Debian 11! My main interest is in Game development, as I said. Also, I and one other friend of mine started a small team, named MONzTER DEVS to make some cool games and other stuff. We shall be making a website for that too in the near future ;). You can check out the organisation on <a href="https://github.com/orgs/MONzTER-DEVS/" target="blank_">Github</a>. (More links at the bottom)

        Now, let's get to the useless part I was talking about. My name is Aditya Nandan, some people may recognize me as !MAD! which is a COOL way of saying "i M' ADi". My home country is India. Other hobbies of mine are, playing free games (ONLY FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES xD), watching movies, hanging out on discord, etc.
